# fern-types
An exploration of compiling a dependently typed call-by-push-value calculus

# FAQs

### **Q**: Isn't this just a hacked together type checker?
**A**: So far, yes. If I get around to it maybe I'll add a front and back end.

### **Q**: What is the plan for this project?
**A**: The pipe dream is to get a nicely working type system and type checker for a calculus that I can easily lower to LLVM, and maybe write some proper front end. If that ever happens, maybe I'll attempt the Bootstrap™️.

### **QQ**: What are dependent types? What is call-by-push-value?
**A**: The more I work on this project, the less confident I am that I know myself.

### **Q**: What is fern?
**A**: A cute name.

### **Q**: Why isn't this in Rocq or Agda?
**A**: I'm not that smart.
