# fern-types
An exploration of compiling a dependently typed call-by-push-value calculus

# FAQs

### **Q**: Isn't this just a hacked together type checker?
**A**: So far, yes. If I get around to it maybe I'll add a front and back end.

### **Q**: Why doesn't this build?
**A**: I haven't got the tests up to date with the type checker yet.

### **Q**: How are the tests not up to date if the tests and type checker were introduced in the same commit?
**A**: This project didn't emerge ex nihilo (nothing ever does), it came from a scratch pile of ideas sitting on my laptop. I didn't want to subject the public to the entirety of my half baked ideas and questionable commit history.

### **Q**: What is the plan for this project?
**A**: The pipe dream is to get a nicely working type system and type checker for a calculus that I can easily lower to LLVM, and maybe write some proper front end. If that ever happens, maybe I'll attempt the Bootstrap™️.

### **QQ**: What are dependent types? What is call-by-push-value?
**A**: The more I work on this project, the less confident I am that I know myself.

### **Q**: What is fern?
**A**: A cute name.

### **Q**: Why isn't this in Rocq or Agda?
**A**: I'm not that smart.
